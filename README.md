Embedding Evaluation for Ancient and Historical
Languages](https://sigtyp.github.io/st2024.html)


## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the

can be executed using [`weasel run [name]`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/tree/main/docs/cli.md#rocket-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `create-pretraining` | Create corpus for multilingual LM pretraining |
| `create-vocab` | Train a tokenizer to create a vocabulary |
| `pretrain-model` | Pretrain a multilingual LM from a corpus |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`weasel run [name]`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/tree/main/docs/cli.md#rocket-run)

inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `pretrain` | `create-pretraining` &rarr; `create-vocab` &rarr; `pretrain-model` |

### üóÇ Assets
