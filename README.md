# ü™ê Weasel Project: LiBERTus - A Multilingual Language Model for Ancient and Historical Languages

Submission to Task 1 (Constrained) of the [SIGTYP 2024 Shared Task on Word
Embedding Evaluation for Ancient and Historical
Languages](https://sigtyp.github.io/st2024.html)


## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[Weasel documentation](https://github.com/explosion/weasel).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`weasel run [name]`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/tree/main/docs/cli.md#rocket-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `create-pretraining` | Create corpus for multilingual LM pretraining |
| `create-vocab` | Train a tokenizer to create a vocabulary |
| `pretrain-model` | Pretrain a multilingual LM from a corpus |
| `pretrain-model-from-checkpoint` | Pretrain a multilingual LM from a corpus based on a checkpoint |
| `upload-to-hf` | Upload pretrained model and corresponding tokenizer to the HuggingFace repository |
| `convert-to-spacy-merged` | Convert CoNLL-U files into spaCy format for finetuning |
| `convert-to-spacy` | Convert CoNLL-U files into spaCy format for finetuning |
| `finetune-tok2vec-model` | Finetune a tok2vec model given a training and validation corpora |
| `finetune-trf-model` | Finetune a transformer model given a training and validation corpora |
| `finetune-with-merged-corpus` | Finetune a transformer model on the combined training and validation corpora |
| `package-model` | Package model and upload to HuggingFace |
| `evaluate-model-dev` | Evaluate a model on the validation set |
| `evaluate-model-test` | Evaluate a model on the test set |
| `plot-figures` | Plot figures for the writeup |
| `setup-test` | Download models from HuggingFace and convert test files to spaCy |
| `get-test-results` | Get results from the test file |
| `special-case-all` | Get results from the test file with both subtokens and mwe |
| `special-case-subtokens-only` | Get results from the test file with subtokens only |
| `zip-results` | Zip the results into a single file for submission |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`weasel run [name]`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/tree/main/docs/cli.md#rocket-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `pretrain` | `create-pretraining` &rarr; `create-vocab` &rarr; `pretrain-model` |
| `finetune` | `convert-to-spacy` &rarr; `finetune-trf-model` &rarr; `evaluate-model-dev` |
| `experiment-merged` | `convert-to-spacy-merged` &rarr; `finetune-with-merged-corpus` |
| `experiment-sampling` | `create-vocab` &rarr; `pretrain-model` |
| `make-submission` | `setup-test` &rarr; `get-test-results` &rarr; `zip-results` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`weasel assets`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/tree/main/docs/cli.md#open_file_folder-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assets/train/` | Git | CoNLL-U training datasets for Task 0 (morphology/lemma/POS) |
| `assets/dev/` | Git | CoNLL-U validation datasets for Task 0 (morphology/lemma/POS) |
| `assets/test/` | Git | CoNLL-U test datasets for Task 0 (morphology/lemma/POS) |
